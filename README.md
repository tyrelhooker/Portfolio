# Portfolio3
By: T.J. Hooker
Date: August 9, 2018

The Portfolio is made with Bootstrap4.

The Portfolio contains 4 html files:
    index.html
    portfolio.html
    contact.html
    about.html

There are two CSS:
    style.css
    reset.css

There is an images folder containing:
    images used for index - main content
    images for "hidden" links throughout the main content
    link images for social media connections
    place holders for the porfolio projects
    background image of the pages

The porfolio is designed to be dynamic, such that the header on each page shrinks with the window and the footer stays at the bottom of the window.
